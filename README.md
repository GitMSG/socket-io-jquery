# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

You can run this application by typing

```
npm install
npm start
```

Once the application starts, go to http://localhost:3000 for an example.

A live example is available at https://blooming-lake-52202.herokuapp.com/

You can also spin up a free Heroku dyno to test it out. Go to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs#deploy-your-application-to-heroku for further instructions.
